USB driver for Meywa-Denki and Kayac YUREX

Meywa-Denki/Kayac YUREX is a leg-shakes sensor device.
See http://bbu.kayac.com/en/about/ for further information.
This driver support read/write the leg-shakes counter in the device
via a device file /dev/yurex[0-9]*.

This driver is merged in Linux-2.6.37.

How to use:
  1. make
  2. sudo make install && modprobe yurex ( or, sudo insmod yurex.ko )
  3. Plug-in YUREX to your computer's USB port.
  4. /dev/yurex0 is created ! (If not, please see below.)
  5. `cat /dev/yurex0` to read the current BBU count.
  6. check some sample programs in sample/

In some environments, usbhid driver may take up the device and
this yurex driver cannot detect it. In this case, a message
below shows up in `dmesg`:
  generic-usb 0003:0C45:1010.0004: input,hidraw2: USB HID v1.10 Device [JESS YUREX] on usb-0000:02:00.0-2.1/input0

To avoid this, you may add udev/99-yurex.rules into /etc/udev/rules.d/ ,
and udev/usb_yurex into /lib/udev/ .
This rule unbind YUREX from the usbhid driver, and re-bind it to yurex driver.
When yurex driver get the device correctly, `dmesg` says:
  yurex 2-2.1:1.0: USB Yurex device now attached to Yurex-224
